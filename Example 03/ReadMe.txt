The code performs a Monte Carlo experiment concerning the impact of side-information in learning the Koopman operator. The results are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19yceYiOE4Wfsu9vKVZgda_wK1NMq3iwz?usp=sharing. You can download the results and copy them in the folder named "results". Then, by running plotting_results.m you can generate the figure.

** IMPORTANT: This Monte Carlo experiment is significantly time-consuming. On a standard PC, each iteration can take up to 1 hours or more. So the running time is approximately 3 x 450 hours on a standard PC. Of course, using a workstation system allows for performing the experiment code more practically.
