The repository contains example of learning Koopman operator for the EDMD method and 
the regularized learning approaches discussed in the reference above, i.e., the following 
learning problem 
   min_K   E(K) + lambda * R(K),
   s.t.    K in C,
where E(.) is the sum squared error loss function, C is a given constraint, 
R(.) is the regularization term.
